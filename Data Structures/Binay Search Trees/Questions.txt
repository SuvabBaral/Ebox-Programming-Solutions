PROBLEM
BINARY SEARCH TREE AND TRAVERSALS
Binary Search Tree
 

Implement a program to construct a Binary Search Tree and also display the elements in the tree using Inorder , Preorder and Postorder traversals.


Create a structure

 struct tnode {
int data;
struct tnode * leftc;
struct tnode * rightc;
};
 

Binary Search tree is a binary tree in which each internal node x stores an element such that the element stored in the left subtree of x are less than x and elements stored in the right subtree of x are greater than or equal to x. This is called binary-search-tree property.

the diameter of T’s left subtree

the diameter of T’s right subtree

HEIGHT BALANCED BST
Height Balanced BST

 

Implement a C program to find whether a given Binary Search Tree is height balanced.

 

Hint:

A tree where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf. Different balancing schemes allow different definitions of “much farther” and different amounts of work to keep them balanced.

 

Consider a height-balancing scheme where following conditions should be checked to determine if a binary tree is balanced.

An empty tree is height-balanced. A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if:

1) Left subtree of T is balanced

2) Right subtree of T is balanced

3) The difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1.]
